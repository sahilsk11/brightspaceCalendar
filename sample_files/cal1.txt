SUMMARY:Midterm 1 - Requires Respondus LockDown Browser + Webcam - Due
LOCATION:Fall 2020 STAT 35000-331 DIS
DESCRIPTION:As a boilermaker pursuing academic excellence\, I pledge to be 
	honest and true in all that I do. Accountable together - we are Purdue.\n I
	nstructions: \n\nYou are expected to uphold the honor code of Purdue Univer
	sity. Anyone cheating on the exam will automatically fail the course and wi
	ll be reported to the Office of Dean of Students. \nIt is strictly prohibit
	ed to take any pictures of this exam. You will be able to view your exam on
	 Brightspace after it is graded. \nThis exam is open book/open notes but yo
	ur internet access is restricted to links specified in the exam itself. It 
	is strongly recommended that you make a cheat sheet instead of trying to go
	 through a large amount of material from your notes or the book during the 
	exam.\nYou are not allowed to talk to anyone during the exam. This is monit
	ored.\nThis is a text only exam. This means that you will use your keyboard
	 to answer all questions. You can write simple equations in one line or you
	 can use Brightspace's equation editor. If you need to use a Greek letter\,
	 you can use the special characters in the LockDown Browser\, Brightspace's
	 function editor\, or just type the name of the letter. You can indicate su
	bscripts by '_' and superscripts by '^' or use Brightspace editor. If you d
	o decide to use a functionality of Brightspace or the LockDown Browser\, pl
	ease practice it ahead of time. Since this exam has integration and more co
	mplicated algebraic functions\, be sure to practice ahead of time concernin
	g how you will be showing this work using your keyboard.\nThere is a 24 hou
	r time window for you to start the exam. However\, once you start the exam\
	, you will have exactly 90 minutes to finish it. If you start the exam too 
	close to the end of the 24 hour time limit\, you will be cut off at that ti
	me. \nYou may use any calculator that you want or the built in scientific c
	alculation in the LockDown Browser.\nThis exam is timed. The timer will con
	tinue whether you leave the room or not. If you do leave the room\, be sure
	 to state why. If you are gone for too long or the reason is not acceptable
	\, we reserve the right to give you a 0 on the exam.\nWe strongly recommend
	 that you bring scratch paper and something to write with. Besides using th
	e paper to work out the problems\, you may submit some or all of the pages 
	to clarify mathematical equations or to include graphics. If you choose to 
	do that\, you will have 10 minutes after you finish the exam to upload the 
	files in the Midterm 1 Upload assignment.\nYou must show ALL of your work o
	n the exam to obtain full credit this includes all mathematical equations e
	ven if they look confusing. In addition\, even if your work includes graphi
	cs that cannot be submitted on the exam\, you still need to include all mat
	hematical work that was done on the exam itself to receive credit for the w
	ork. An answer without showing any work may result in zero credit. Any expl
	anation that you provide must be complete to receive full credit. If you pr
	ovide code for work from Chapters 4 -7\, you will receive a 0 on that part.
	 All normal distribution probabilities and percentiles must use the z-table
	\; this means that you cannot use a graphing calculator to obtain the answe
	rs. If the answer cannot be determined from either the z-table in the book 
	or the one that is provided on the exam\, you will receive a 0 on that part
	. \nAll numeric answers should have at least two decimal places unless stat
	ed otherwise except for probabilities from the z-table that have to have fo
	ur-decimal places.\nAll questions\, both multiple choice and free response 
	will be randomized. The possible answers to the multiple choice questions m
	ight or might not be randomized.\nThe exam is out of 100 points\; however\,
	 the points on Brightspace are 105.001.  Please use the value of the score 
	in all grade calculations\, not the percentage.\n\nYou will electronically 
	acknowledge that you agree to abide by the following in the first question.
	\n \nI attest here that I have read and followed the instructions above hon
	estly while taking this exam and that the work submitted is my own\, produc
	ed without assistance from other people (including other students in this c
	lass). In addition\, I agree that if I tell any other student in this class
	 anything about the exam BEFORE they take it\, I (and the student that I co
	mmunicate the information to) will fail the course and be reported to the O
	ffice of the Dean of Students for Academic Dishonesty.\n\n\n\n\nQuizzes:\nM

	mplicated algebraic functions\, be sure to practice ahead of time concernin
	g how you will be showing this work using your keyboard.\nThere is a 24 hou

	However\, once you start the exam\, you will have exactly 70 minutes to fin
	ish it. If you start the exam too close to the end of the 24 hour time limi
	t\, you will be cut off at that time. \nYou may use any calculator that you
	 want or the built in scientific calculation in the LockDown Browser.\nThis
	 exam is timed. The timer will continue whether you leave the room or not. 
	If you do leave the room\, be sure to state why. If you are gone for too lo
	ng or the reason is not acceptable\, we reserve the right to give you a 0 o
	n the exam.\nWe strongly recommend that you bring scratch paper and somethi
	ng to write with. \nYou must show ALL of your work on the exam to obtain fu
	ll credit. An answer without showing any work may result in zero credit. An
	y explanation that you provide must be complete to receive full credit. \nA
	ll numeric answers should have at least two decimal places unless stated ot
	herwise.\nAll questions\, both multiple choice and free response will be ra
	ndomized. The possible answers to the multiple choice questions might or mi
	ght not be randomized.\nThe exam is out of 100 points\; however\, the point
	s on Brightspace are 105.001. Please use the value of the score in all grad
	e calculations\, not the percentage.\nYou must complete all of the pre-test
	 actions including showing your ID and showing your working space in the en
	vironmental video or you will loose 5 points. It is also recommended that y
	ou speak when creating the environmental video to be sure that your microph

	pen book/open notes but your internet access is restricted to links specifi
	ed in the exam itself. It is strongly recommended that you make a cheat she
	et instead of trying to go through a large amount of material from your not
	es or the book during the exam.\nYou are not allowed to talk to anyone duri
	ng the exam. This is monitored.\nThis is a text only exam. This means that 
	you will use your keyboard to answer all questions. You can write simple eq
	uations in one line or you can use Brightspace's equation editor. If you ne
	ed to use a Greek letter\, you can use the special characters in the LockDo
	wn Browser\, Brightspace's function editor\, or just type the name of the l
	etter. You can indicate subscripts by '_' and superscripts by '^' or use Br
	ightspace editor. If you do decide to use a functionality of Brightspace or
	 the LockDown Browser\, please practice it ahead of time. This exam might h
	ave integration and/or more complicated algebraic functions. Be sure to pra
	ctice ahead of time how you will be showing this work using your keyboard.\
	nThere is a 29 hour time window for you to start the exam. However\, once y

	start the exam too close to the end of the 29 hour time limit\, you will be

	 The timer will continue whether you leave the room or not. If you do leave
	 the room\, be sure to state why. If you are gone for too long or the reaso
	n is not acceptable\, we reserve the right to give you a 0 on the exam.\nWe
	 strongly recommend that you bring scratch paper and something to write wit
	h. Besides using the paper to work out the problems\, you may submit some o
	r all of the pages to clarify mathematical equations or to include graphics
	 that are used for the questions concerning probability like for Midterm 1.
	 If you choose to do that\, you will have 10 minutes after you finish the e
	xam to upload the files in the Final Upload assignment. We will only look a

	s used on the exam. [Note that there is no upload for the Final Practice Ex

	 includes all mathematical equations even if they look very confusing. In a
	ddition\, even if your work includes graphics that can not be submitted on 
	the exam\, you still need to include all mathematical work that was done on
	 the exam itself. Work submitted in the supplemental material is only a cla
	rification of work shown on the exam itself. We will not consider informati
	on in the supplemental material that is not on the exam. An answer without 
	showing any work on the exam may result in zero credit. Any explanation tha

	ng the exam. This is monitored.\nThis is a text only exam. This means that 
	you will use your keyboard to answer all questions. You can write simple eq
	uations in one line or you can use Brightspace's equation editor. If you ne
	ed to use a Greek letter\, you can use the special characters in the LockDo
	wn Browser\, Brightspace's function editor\, or just type the name of the l
	etter. You can indicate subscripts by '_' and superscripts by '^' or use Br
	ightspace editor. If you do decide to use a functionality of Brightspace or
	 the LockDown Browser\, please practice it ahead of time. This exam might h
	ave integration and/or more complicated algebraic functions. Be sure to pra
	ctice ahead of time how you will be showing this work using your keyboard.\
	nThere is a 29 hour time window for you to start the exam. However\, once y

	start the exam too close to the end of the 29 hour time limit\, you will be
	 cut off at that time. \nYou may use any calculator that you want or the bu
	ilt in scientific calculation in the LockDown Browser. However\, the comple
	te work for all integration must be shown on the exam.\nThis exam is timed.
	 The timer will continue whether you leave the room or not. If you do leave
	 the room\, be sure to state why. If you are gone for too long or the reaso
	n is not acceptable\, we reserve the right to give you a 0 on the exam.\nWe
	 strongly recommend that you bring scratch paper and something to write wit
	h. Besides using the paper to work out the problems\, you may submit some o
	r all of the pages to clarify mathematical equations or to include graphics
	 that are used for the questions concerning probability like for Midterm 1.
	 If you choose to do that\, you will have 10 minutes after you finish the e

	 the exam itself. Work submitted in the supplemental material is only a cla
	rification of work shown on the exam itself. We will not consider informati

SUMMARY:CITI Training for Human Subject Research - Due
LOCATION:Fall 2020 HONR 29900-076 DIS
DESCRIPTION:Human Subject Research refers to research in which the investig
	ator is collecting primary data by interacting with people. It is imperativ
	e that we are ethical in our data collection practices to ensure that our s
	ubjects are left unharmed by the work we conduct. Even as undergraduates\, 
	you too need to be knowledgeable about the ethics of conducting human subje
	ct research and undergo training BEFORE you engage in any primary data coll
	ection.\nWhat is CITI Training?\nThe Collaborative Institutional Training I
	nitiative (CITI) Human Research Protections Training Course is a self-paced
	 web-based training program covering core ethical concepts and regulatory r
	equirements. Purdue University requires all individuals engaged in the cond
	uct of human subject research to have current CITI certification\, which ma
	y be updated by a refresher course after 4 years. (Purdue IRB 2020).\nPleas
	e visit Purdue's IRB website for more instructions on completing online CIT
	I training. You want to select the "Learner Group" that corresponds with yo
	ur role in the research--that role is undergraduate researcher.\nYour Data 
	(Observation) Protocol will NOT be accepted until your CITI training is com
	plete. Please submit a screenshot of your CITI completion or the PDF certif
	icate of completion provided by CITI.\n\n\nAssignments:\nCITI Training for

SUMMARY:Project - main project only - Due
LOCATION:Fall 2020 STAT 35000-331 DIS
DESCRIPTION:The project is due Tuesday\, August 4\, before midnight on Brig
	htspace. Please read the assignment for more details. The main contribution
	 is submitted here. Remember that there is only one submission per group.\n
	There are two data sets used for the project. They are both in the same loc
	ation as our fifa data set at  /depot/statclass/data/stat35000/2020summer/.
	 \nThe first data is concerning university data and is called univsu20.txt.
	 The second data set has COVID-19 information per each US state and territo
	ry that was listed in the data that I was using and is called covidsu20.txt
	. By definition\, the information in the COVID-19 data set is out-of-date. 
	In the data description\, there is a link to the most recent source which y
	ou may use if you want. You also may search for a data set that is more rel
	evant to your interests.\nUPDATE 7/28: 7:15 am EDT: The link for the NY Tim
	es COVID-19 data at github had a typo in it\, the correct link is: https://
	github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data\n\n\nAssignments:\nProject - main project
