SUMMARY:Midterm 1 Practice Exam - Available
LOCATION:Fall 2020 STAT 35000-331 DIS
DESCRIPTION:As a boilermaker pursuing academic excellence\, I pledge to be 
	honest and true in all that I do. Accountable together - we are Purdue.\n I
	nstructions: \n\nYou are expected to uphold the honor code of Purdue Univer
	sity. Anyone cheating on the exam will automatically fail the course and wi
	ll be reported to the Office of Dean of Students. \nIt is strictly prohibit
	ed to take any pictures of this exam. You will be able to view your exam on
	 Brightspace after it is graded. \nThis exam is open book/open notes but yo
	ur internet access is restricted to links specified in the exam itself. It 
	is strongly recommended that you make a cheat sheet instead of trying to go
	 through a large amount of material.\nYou are not allowed to talk to anyone
	 during the exam. This is monitored.\nThis is a text only exam. This means 
	that you will use your keyboard to answer all questions. You can write simp
	le equations in one line or you can use Brightspace's equation editor. If y
	ou need to use a Greek letter\, you can use the special characters in the L
	ockDown Browser\, Brightspace's function editor or just type the name of th
	e letter. You can indicate subscripts by '_' and superscripts by '^' or use
	 Brightspace editor. If you do decide to use a functionality of Brightspace
	\, please practice it ahead of time. This exam does not have integration in
	cluded and more complicated algebraic functions. Be sure to practice ahead 
	of time how you will be showing this work using your keyboard. \nThere is a
	 24 hour time window for you to start the exam. However\, once you start th
	e exam\, you will have exactly 90 minutes to finish it. If you start the ex
	am too close to the end of the 24 hour time limit\, you will be cut off at 
	that time. \nYou may use any calculator that you want or the built in scien
	tific calculation in the LockDown Browser.\nThis exam is timed. The timer w
	ill continue whether you leave the room or not. If you do leave the room\, 
	be sure to state why. If you are gone for too long or the reason is not acc
	eptable\, we reserve the right to give you a 0 on the exam.\nWe strongly re
	commend that you bring scratch paper and something to write with. Besides u
	sing the paper to work out the problems\, you may submit some or all of the
	 pages to clarify mathematical equations or to include graphics. If you cho
	ose to do that\, you will have 10 minutes after you finish the exam to uplo
	ad the files in the Midterm 1 Upload assignment. [Note that there is no upl
	oad for the Midterm 1 Practice Exam.]\nYou must show ALL of your work on th
	e exam to obtain full credit this includes all mathematical equations even 
	if they look very confusing. In addition\, even if your work includes graph
	ics that can not be submitted on the exam\, you still need to include all m
	athematical work that was done on the exam itself. An answer without showin
	g any work may result in zero credit. Any explanation that you provide must
	 be complete to receive full credit. \nAll numeric answers should have two 
	decimal places unless stated otherwise except for probabilities from the z-
	table that have to have four-decimal places.\nAll questions\, both multiple
	 choice and free response will be randomized. The possible answers to the m
	ultiple choice questions might or might not be randomized.\nThe exam is out
	 of 100 points\, but there 105 points available which is what is shown on B
	rightspace. Please use the value of the score in all grade calculations\, n
	ot the percentage.\n\nYou will electronically acknowledge that you agree to
	 abide by the following in the first question.\n \nI attest here that I hav
	e read and followed the instructions above honestly while taking this exam 
	and that the work submitted is my own\, produced without assistance from ot
	her people (including other students in this class). In addition\, I agree 
	that if I tell any other student in this class anything about the exam BEFO
	RE they take it\, I (and the student that I communicate the information to)
	 will fail the course and be reported to the Office of the Dean of Students

	e letter. You can indicate subscripts by '_' and superscripts by '^' or use
	 Brightspace editor. If you do decide to use a functionality of Brightspace
	\, please practice it ahead of time. This exam does not have integration in
	cluded and more complicated algebraic functions. Be sure to practice ahead 
	of time how you will be showing this work using your keyboard. \nThere is a
	 24 hour time window for you to start the exam. However\, once you start th
	e exam\, you will have exactly 90 minutes to finish it. If you start the ex

	commend that you bring scratch paper and something to write with. Besides u
	sing the paper to work out the problems\, you may submit some or all of the
	 pages to clarify mathematical equations or to include graphics. If you cho
	ose to do that\, you will have 10 minutes after you finish the exam to uplo
	ad the files in the Midterm 1 Upload assignment. [Note that there is no upl
	oad for the Midterm 1 Practice Exam.]\nYou must show ALL of your work on th
	e exam to obtain full credit this includes all mathematical equations even 
	if they look very confusing. In addition\, even if your work includes graph
	ics that can not be submitted on the exam\, you still need to include all m
	athematical work that was done on the exam itself. An answer without showin
	g any work may result in zero credit. Any explanation that you provide must
	 be complete to receive full credit. \nAll numeric answers should have two 
	decimal places unless stated otherwise except for probabilities from the z-
	table that have to have four-decimal places.\nAll questions\, both multiple
	 choice and free response will be randomized. The possible answers to the m
	ultiple choice questions might or might not be randomized.\nThe exam is out
	 of 100 points\, but there 105 points available which is what is shown on B
	rightspace. Please use the value of the score in all grade calculations\, n
	ot the percentage.\n\nYou will electronically acknowledge that you agree to

	et instead of trying to go through a large amount of material from your not

	ng the exam. This is monitored.\nThis is a text only exam. This means that 
	you will use your keyboard to answer all questions. You can write simple eq

	ightspace editor. If you do decide to use a functionality of Brightspace or
	 the LockDown Browser\, please practice it ahead of time. This exam might h
	ave integration and/or more complicated algebraic functions. Be sure to pra
	ctice ahead of time how you will be showing this work using your keyboard.\
	nThere is a 29 hour time window for you to start the exam. However\, once y
	ou start the exam\, you will have exactly 140 minutes to finish it. If you 
	start the exam too close to the end of the 29 hour time limit\, you will be
	 cut off at that time. \nYou may use any calculator that you want or the bu
	ilt in scientific calculation in the LockDown Browser. However\, the comple
	te work for all integration must be shown on the exam.\nThis exam is timed.
	 The timer will continue whether you leave the room or not. If you do leave
	 the room\, be sure to state why. If you are gone for too long or the reaso
	n is not acceptable\, we reserve the right to give you a 0 on the exam.\nWe
	 strongly recommend that you bring scratch paper and something to write wit
	h. Besides using the paper to work out the problems\, you may submit some o
	r all of the pages to clarify mathematical equations or to include graphics
	 that are used for the questions concerning probability like for Midterm 1.
	 If you choose to do that\, you will have 10 minutes after you finish the e
	xam to upload the files in the Final Upload assignment. We will only look a
	t the supplementary data IF we need clarification for mathematical equation
	s used on the exam. [Note that there is no upload for the Final Practice Ex
	am.]\nYou must show ALL of your work on the exam to obtain full credit this
	 includes all mathematical equations even if they look very confusing. In a
	ddition\, even if your work includes graphics that can not be submitted on 
	the exam\, you still need to include all mathematical work that was done on
	 the exam itself. Work submitted in the supplemental material is only a cla
	rification of work shown on the exam itself. We will not consider informati
	on in the supplemental material that is not on the exam. An answer without 
	showing any work on the exam may result in zero credit. Any explanation tha
	t you provide must be complete to receive full credit.\nAll numeric answers
	 should have two decimal places unless stated otherwise except for probabil
	ities from the z-table that have to have four-decimal places.\nAll question
	s\, both multiple choice and free response will be randomized. The possible
	 answers to the multiple choice questions might or might not be randomized.
	\nThe exam is out of 135 points\; however\, the points on Brightspace are 1
	50.001. Please take this into consideration when calculating your grade.\n[
	in the actual exam\, not the practice] You must complete all of the pre-tes
	t actions including showing your ID and showing your working space in the e
	nvironmental video or you will lose 5 points. It is also recommended that y

	wn Browser\, Brightspace's function editor\, or just type the name of the l
	etter. You can indicate subscripts by '_' and superscripts by '^' or use Br
	ightspace editor. If you do decide to use a functionality of Brightspace or
	 the LockDown Browser\, please practice it ahead of time. This exam might h
	ave integration and/or more complicated algebraic functions. Be sure to pra
	ctice ahead of time how you will be showing this work using your keyboard.\
	nThere is a 29 hour time window for you to start the exam. However\, once y
	ou start the exam\, you will have exactly 140 minutes to finish it. If you 
	start the exam too close to the end of the 29 hour time limit\, you will be
	 cut off at that time. \nYou may use any calculator that you want or the bu
	ilt in scientific calculation in the LockDown Browser. However\, the comple
	te work for all integration must be shown on the exam.\nThis exam is timed.
	 The timer will continue whether you leave the room or not. If you do leave
	 the room\, be sure to state why. If you are gone for too long or the reaso
	n is not acceptable\, we reserve the right to give you a 0 on the exam.\nWe
	 strongly recommend that you bring scratch paper and something to write wit
	h. Besides using the paper to work out the problems\, you may submit some o
	r all of the pages to clarify mathematical equations or to include graphics
	 that are used for the questions concerning probability like for Midterm 1.
	 If you choose to do that\, you will have 10 minutes after you finish the e
	xam to upload the files in the Final Upload assignment. We will only look a
	t the supplementary data IF we need clarification for mathematical equation
	s used on the exam. [Note that there is no upload for the Final Practice Ex
	am.]\nYou must show ALL of your work on the exam to obtain full credit this
	 includes all mathematical equations even if they look very confusing. In a
	ddition\, even if your work includes graphics that can not be submitted on 
	the exam\, you still need to include all mathematical work that was done on
	 the exam itself. Work submitted in the supplemental material is only a cla
	rification of work shown on the exam itself. We will not consider informati
	on in the supplemental material that is not on the exam. An answer without 
	showing any work on the exam may result in zero credit. Any explanation tha
	t you provide must be complete to receive full credit.\nAll numeric answers
	 should have two decimal places unless stated otherwise except for probabil
	ities from the z-table that have to have four-decimal places.\nAll question
	s\, both multiple choice and free response will be randomized. The possible
	 answers to the multiple choice questions might or might not be randomized.
	\nThe exam is out of 135 points\; however\, the points on Brightspace are 1
	50.001. Please take this into consideration when calculating your grade.\n[
	in the actual exam\, not the practice] You must complete all of the pre-tes
	t actions including showing your ID and showing your working space in the e
	nvironmental video or you will lose 5 points. It is also recommended that y

LOCATION:Fall 2020 HONR 29900-076 DIS
DESCRIPTION:<p><strong>Film Description</strong>:</p>\n<p><em>Mathieu Kasso
	vitz took the film world by storm with LA HAINE\, a gritty\, unsettling\, a
	nd visually explosive look at the racial and cultural volatility in modern-
	day France\, specifically the low-income </em>banlieue<em> districts on Par
	is's outskirts.</em></p>\n<p><em>Aimlessly passing their days in the concre
	te environs of their dead-end suburbia\, Vinz (Vincent Cassel)\, Hubert (Hu
	bert Kounde)\, and Said (Said Taghmaoui) -- a Jew\, an African\, and an Ara
	b -- give human faces to France's immigrant populations\, their bristling r
	esentment at their marginalization slowly simmering until it reaches a clim
	actic boiling point. A work of tough beauty\, LA HAINE is a landmark of con
	temporary French cinema and a gripping reflection of its country's ongoing 
	identity crisis.</em></p>\n<p><em>Kassovits won Best Director and the film 
	was nominated for the Palm d'Or at the 1995&nbsp\;<strong>Cannes Film Festi
	val</strong>.</em></p>\n<div>\n<div>Running Time&nbsp\;</div>\n<div>98 mins

SUMMARY:CITI Training for Human Subject Research - Due
LOCATION:Fall 2020 HONR 29900-076 DIS
DESCRIPTION:Human Subject Research refers to research in which the investig
	ator is collecting primary data by interacting with people. It is imperativ
	e that we are ethical in our data collection practices to ensure that our s
	ubjects are left unharmed by the work we conduct. Even as undergraduates\, 
	you too need to be knowledgeable about the ethics of conducting human subje
	ct research and undergo training BEFORE you engage in any primary data coll
	ection.\nWhat is CITI Training?\nThe Collaborative Institutional Training I
	nitiative (CITI) Human Research Protections Training Course is a self-paced
	 web-based training program covering core ethical concepts and regulatory r
	equirements. Purdue University requires all individuals engaged in the cond
	uct of human subject research to have current CITI certification\, which ma
	y be updated by a refresher course after 4 years. (Purdue IRB 2020).\nPleas
	e visit Purdue's IRB website for more instructions on completing online CIT
	I training. You want to select the "Learner Group" that corresponds with yo
	ur role in the research--that role is undergraduate researcher.\nYour Data 
	(Observation) Protocol will NOT be accepted until your CITI training is com
	plete. Please submit a screenshot of your CITI completion or the PDF certif
	icate of completion provided by CITI.\n\n\nAssignments:\nCITI Training for

SUMMARY:Project - main project only - Due
LOCATION:Fall 2020 STAT 35000-331 DIS
DESCRIPTION:The project is due Tuesday\, August 4\, before midnight on Brig
	htspace. Please read the assignment for more details. The main contribution
	 is submitted here. Remember that there is only one submission per group.\n
	There are two data sets used for the project. They are both in the same loc
	ation as our fifa data set at  /depot/statclass/data/stat35000/2020summer/.
	 \nThe first data is concerning university data and is called univsu20.txt.
	 The second data set has COVID-19 information per each US state and territo
	ry that was listed in the data that I was using and is called covidsu20.txt
	. By definition\, the information in the COVID-19 data set is out-of-date. 
	In the data description\, there is a link to the most recent source which y
	ou may use if you want. You also may search for a data set that is more rel
	evant to your interests.\nUPDATE 7/28: 7:15 am EDT: The link for the NY Tim
	es COVID-19 data at github had a typo in it\, the correct link is: https://
	github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data\n\n\nAssignments:\nProject - main project
